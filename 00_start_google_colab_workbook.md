# What is a Jupyter Notebook?

- Jupyter Notebooks
    - Combined text + code
    - Create reports, interactive documents, graphs, run code 
    - A series of “cells” in a notebook

- Text Cells
    - Cells which allow text and images text is normally formatted in "markdown"
    - Markdown has an easy to learn syntax for formatting text
    - you can find more information here [Basic Syntax](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/)
    - another option is to ask an AI like [ChatGPT](https://chatgpt.com/?oai-dm=1)

- Code Cells
    - Cells which run code (i.e., Python)
    - Code cells have two primary inputs:
       - code
       - comments (indicated as anything preceded by a #)
    - To run code cells click the white triangle in the black circle this is the "play button" 

- Output Cells
    - Temporary cells which produce output from a code cell

- Examples
    - A code cell waiting to be run
    	- looks like this

	- A code cell which has been run 
		- notice the small green check by the play button:
		- notice the data now in the output cell

	- A code cell which has encountered an error
		- notice the red circle with a white ! by the play button
		- notice the error message in the output cell
